      Make software engineering collaborative and joyful again.
    </h2>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      Developers write software within languages/frameworks, build tools, glue
      them together to (tool) chains, develop against APIs and communicate and
      collaborate with our colleagues. All of that should be efficient, joyful
      and secure.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      Yet it is not. Devs constantly struggle with larger codebases, cluttered
      dependencies, security policies and unnecessary friction in their
      workflows.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      We want to make developers feel again that everything is at their
      fingertips.
    </p>
    <h2 class="h4 mt-5rem">
      Gitpod was founded because we were frustrated by manually setting up and
      maintaining dev environments.
    </h2>
    <p class="text-2xl">
      We are building Gitpod in the open to easily spin-up fresh dev
      environments for any task. Those ephemeral environments are fast &
      powerful, fully automated & initialized. They empower developers to
      immediately start coding, debugging, and testing their code.
    </p>
    <p class="text-2xl">Only then developers are always ready-to-code.</p>
    <h2 class="h4 mt-5rem">
      The company was established in 2020 and today over 350,000 devs
      gitpodified their workflows.

    <p class="text-2xl">
      We are greateful to be backed by some of the best venture firms and
      advisors of the world. We recently announced a 13m funding round.
