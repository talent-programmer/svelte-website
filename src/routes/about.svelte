  <h2>Obsessed with developer experience.</h2>
  <p>
    We have built developer tools, created programming languages and
    successfully grew open source communities over the last 10 years. We are
    developers ourselves - with Gitpod we want to capitalize on our learnings
    and build a company that simplifies the lives of all developers. Experienced
    international investors support us on our journey. We are a fully

  <h2>Built on Shared Principles</h2>
  <p>
    Values are important to us. We are developer-led and aim for a frictionless
    experience when interacting with our product, our company and our brand: no
    hurdles, no BS, no unnecessary extra steps. We believe in the benefits of an
    open culture. We are open minded, inclusive, transparent and curious. We
    always remain students of the game, not masters of the game. We have
    opinions, but are not opinionated. We integrate, don't dictate.
