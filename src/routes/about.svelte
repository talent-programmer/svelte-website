<h1>On a mission to make developers' lives easier!</h1>
<p>
  We’re a fully distributed and engineering-led team of developer tool
  specialists and long time open-source contributors. We believe that in a few
  years working with automated, ready-to-code dev environments is going to be as
  common as using version control or having CI/CD.

  <h2>Democratizing Software Development</h2>
  <p>
    We have built developer tools, created programming languages and
    successfully grew open source communities over the last 10 years. We are
    developers ourselves - with Gitpod we want to capitalize on our learnings
    and build a company that simplifies the lives of all developers. Experienced
    international investors support us on our journey. We are a fully
    distributed team with humans from all over the world.

  <h2>Diversity at Gitpod</h2>
  <p>
    Values are important to us. We are developer-led and aim for a frictionless
    experience when interacting with our product, our company and our brand: no
    hurdles, no BS, no unnecessary extra steps. We believe in the benefits of an
    open culture. We are open minded, inclusive, transparent and curious. We
    always remain students of the game, not masters of the game. We have
    opinions, but are not opinionated. We integrate, don't dictate. We are also
    not as diverse as we would like to be.

    We’re on the hunt for new talent, as what we’re building is going to take a
    lot of it

    doing enough to come along for the ride.
