On the [27th of April there will be a one-day virtual conference](https://gitpodcommunityday.org) where members from the Gitpod team will be spending dedicated time with you, our community.

At the Gitpod Community day you'll learn about the north stars that are guiding product development from our CEO - Sven Efftinge and the inner technical architecture of Gitpod from our Chief Architect - Christian Weichel. Michael Friedrich from GitLab will be making an appearance to provide insights into how Gitpod makes it easier for open-source maintainers to attract contributors and, finally, Gitpod will also be revealing some exciting initiatives but Shhh...Spoilers!

After the talks, the conference is largely unstructured as it is about spending time with each other. Sven, Christian and other members of Gitpod will be available all day to spend time with you.

Last week we announced a [$13m funding round](/blog/next-chapter-for-gitpod) led by General Catalyst to accelerate our roadmap and continue to build out a fully distributed world-class team to define a new product category in modern software development and move software development to the cloud. [We are hiring](/careers) ([internationally + remote](https://ghuntley.com/a-new-chapter)) and this the perfect opportunity to ask any questions you may have about life at Gitpod.

The Gitpod [discord channel](/chat) is where the event will be taking place. Make sure you have your microphone + camera set up and ready as there will be many video breakout opportunities.

Registration for the Gitpod Community Day is now open and more information can be found at https://gitpodcommunityday.org/
